Installation
=======================

- Copy PHPAutoSprites directory into your project

- Open PHPAutoSprites/sprites.php and change configuration.

- Set permissions for PHPAutoSprites/data (read and write) and SPRITE_DIR 
so that PHP has read and write access

- Include PHPAutoSprites/sprites.php into your projects files

- Now you can use PHPAutoSprites:

Instead of:

<head>
	<title>No sprites</title>
</head>
<body>
	<img src="images/img.png" alt="an_image" />
</body>

do:
<?php require_once('PHPAutoSprites/sprites.php')?>

<head>
	<title>With sprites</title>
	<?php echo Sprite::style()?>
</head>
<body>
	<?php echo Sprite::image('images/img.png', array(
		'alt' => 'an_image'))?>
</body>


You can also use Sprite::input for image inputs or any other HTML element 
via Sprite::htmlElement

If you want to have hover effect, place the hover image into the same directory
like the default image and append _hover onto the file name. 
If your file name is image.png, the hover image will be image_hover.png.
